It should also reference a replay of playing that player and the reason the case is included here.

Case 1 (12/17/2015):

Opponent- shu

Manual Mod Info- 
height=9
positions=8 5 5 7
width=9
symmetric=false

Replay link- http://www.codingame.com/replay/33625249

Reasons to include-
1. Demonstrates how Sean fixed the problem where the opponent reached the gap and we didn't horizontal wall him
   backwards in advance before it was too late, and instead tried to place an invalid vertical wall
2. Demonstrates a problem with our best path... as in we go back and forth a bunch of times which sucks
3. Our should_lock and lock functions ran and worked! That was cool to see
